Choose Midi Channels for Treble- and Bass-Track

Delphi and Lazarus projects for Windows. 

You can use this software for preparation for special instruments. This instruments have a trebel and a bass side. I use it as a first step to prepare to generate printed sheet music for the "Steirische" harmonica:

For each voice I select one or more channels and save them in midi files. In the next step I prepare it for "Griffschrift". This is specific to diatonic instruments. In the third step I generate a ".mscx"-File in order to generate printed sheet music (in "Griffschrift") with MuseScore.

For the two last steps I use my own programm, my "Midi-Sequenzer":
